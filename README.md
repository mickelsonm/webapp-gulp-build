# webapp-gulp-build

This is a boilerplate application which leverages automated gulp processes.

Original seed project came from/was generated by `yo generator-gulp-webapp`.

Modified slightly for my own taste (not use ES6, added angular, etc)

## How to build?

Just run:

    bower install && npm install

    gulp build

## How to run?

    gulp serve

## How to contribute?

Simply fork this project, make your changes, and submit a pull request!

## Licensing

MIT, but see what the licensing is for the generator mentioned above. This is
just software that I am only playing with for fun.
